# turkish_makam_tuning_intonation_dataset
A dataset of Turkish makam music to test tuning and intonation analysis methodologies

The dataset is aimed at testing note modeling, tuning and intonation analysis methodologies for Turkish-Ottoman makam music. This repository is composed of 400 recordings sampled uniformly from the 20 most performed makams in the CompMusic makam corpus. Each recording has a SymbTr score, hence score-informed methodologies can also be applied.
