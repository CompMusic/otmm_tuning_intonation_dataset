# turkish_makam_tuning_intonation_dataset
A dataset of Turkish makam music to test tuning and intonation analysis methodologies

The dataset is aimed at testing note modeling, tuning and intonation analysis methodologies for Turkish-Ottoman makam music. This repository is composed of 400 recordings, sampled uniformly from the 20 most performed makams in the CompMusic makam music corpus. 

The recordings are currently restricted to the classical performances as the results are easier to compare with the "better-defined" classical makam music theories. We have selected the recordings from the three most performed forms (i.e. peşrev, sazsemaisi and şarkı) in the classical genre for the sake of coverage. Each recording has an associated [SymbTr-score](https://github.com/MTG/SymbTr), hence score-informed methodologies can also be applied.
