# turkish_makam_tuning_intonation_dataset
A dataset of Turkish makam music to test tuning and intonation analysis methodologies

The dataset is aimed at testing note modeling, tuning and intonation analysis methodologies for Turkish-Ottoman makam music. This repository is composed of 400 recordings, sampled uniformly from the 20 most performed makams in the CompMusic makam music corpus. The recordings are currently restricted from the classical genre as it's easier to compare the results to the "better-defined" classical makam music theories. Each recording has a SymbTr score, hence score-informed methodologies can also be applied. We selected the recordings from the three most performed forms (i.e. peşrev, sazsemaisi and şarkı) in the classical genre for the sake of coverage.
